To use slg46826.py, slg46826_parser.py, the following packages were installed
with pip:

Package             Version
------------------- -------
cffi                1.16.0
pip                 24.0
pycparser           2.21
pycparser-fake-libc 2.21

Exact version should not be a hard requirement, but this is what these were
tested with.
